Problembeschreibung von Adam:
    kbuild suggests: PCI_LABEL depends on PCI
    PCI_LABEL <=> (DMI || ACPI); ACPI depends on PCI, but DMI does not
    both, PCI and DMI are defined in arch/*, so I don't know whether to make
    DMI depend on PCI in all of them, or make PCI_LABEL depend on PCI

\drivers\pci\Kconfig:117:
    config PCI_LABEL
        def_bool y if (DMI || ACPI)
        select NLS
